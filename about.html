        <h2>Why is this site named UX Origami?</h2>
        <p>Two reasons. One, I’m a nerd and I’m into origami. I started paper folding when I was a child. My parents both worked and I often had to go to work with them. I started making origami animals to entertain myself (this was pre-smart phones). I enjoyed it so I’ve never really stopped. Now I make flowers, Star Wars characters, and random icons!</p>
          <br>
          <p>The second reason is that I see a lot of parallels between origami and UX. With careful planning and meticulous application, we gather data again and again, building a complex picture piece by piece. This becomes a string of insights designers transform into an interface people enjoy.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I love this quote from David Okuniev, Co-founder of Typeform, “Origami is the art of using precise folding patterns and sequences to create something beautiful out of almost nothing—a piece of paper. UI design is also the outcome of many small, meticulously assembled elements coming together. So in many ways, building a perfect user interface is like folding together a perfect paper swan.”</p>

        <h2>Why I got into UX</h2>
        <p>Before going to grad school I worked in the Marketing & Communications field in Detroit for about 10 years. In addition to learning how to design, it taught me a lot about listening to customers and tailoring messaging to the needs of customers.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In 2014 I moved to South Korea for my husband’s work. While there I continued freelancing and ended up working a UX-related role in which I led a team to redesign an organization’s website. I loved working with users, and puzzling out how to balance their needs with those of the organization.</p>
          <br>
        <p>At the same time Samsung was looking for American women in Seoul to test their North American smart fridge touchscreen interface. I became a tester and did some moderated usability tests for them. So I got to work both sides of usability tests and I really enjoyed it.</p>
          <br>
        <p>When we moved back to Detroit in 2017 I decided to look for more opportunities like that. I found the University of Michigan’s UX masters program and thought that would be a great way to learn more about the industry and get more experience with real clients. For more info on my work history see my resume or LinkedIn profile. Thanks for visiting!</p>
