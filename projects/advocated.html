        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>This one is all me! I worked on this for an Interaction Design class, September - December 2018.</p>

        <h2>Project</h2>
        <p>Designing a mid-fi app prototype that allows parents of children with special needs to share information with each other about what school services their children receive.</p>
      </section>

        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>It’s difficult to find out what resources are offered at local schools for children with special needs.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="project_description secondary">
        <img src="../images/icons/blue_goals.jpg" alt="icon of arrow hitting bullseye target"/>
        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>I wanted to choose a problem that currently has no digital solution on the market. Of all the project ideas I came up with, this was the one I thought would make the biggest impact, if it ever became a reality.
          <br> <br>
          According to the National Center for Education Statistics, 6.7 million children in public schools receive special education services. The parents of these children have to learn how to navigate private and public services to get help for their children. While there is helpful information online about how to advocate, there is very little information about what to advocate for.
          <br> <br>
          That is why I decided to make this app: To give parents a place they can search and see what other children with similar needs receive. This will allow them to better prepare for meetings with school officials, as well as assess what schools would best meet their needs. In short, it will help parents better advocate for their child’s educational needs. Schools would also benefit from parents having a clearer picture of what services are offered, as they often deal with parents who have unrealistic expectations or are misinformed.
          <br> <br>
          Specifically, my app allows parents to anonymously post the information from their child’s service plans (e.g. their IEP or Section 504 plan). This information would be tagged with the school name as well as the special need/disability category. It then goes into a database which is searchable by other users. Thus anyone could research the programs, services, supplemental aids, and goals available to students by school or by keyword.</p>

      <section class="project_description">
        <img src="../images/icons/orange_research.jpg" alt="icon of magnifying glass"/>
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>Researched this problem and the current solutions on the market in order to determine what features are currently missing and hypothesize a solution.
          <br> <br>
          Competitive Analysis: Assessed the strengths and weakness of competitors. My app doesn’t have any direct competitors that I could find, so I analyzed indirect and parallel competitors. Currently, if parents want to know what resources a school offers for a particular need, they have to directly ask someone either in person or online. School websites are usually vague, if they mention special education services at all.
          <br> <br>
          Surveyed 100+ potential users (parents of children with special needs and Special Ed Educators). I asked them about their current advocacy-related frustrations and the IEP/504 process as well as their tech skills and habits. With that data I wrote 5 personas and use case scenarios for each.
          <br> <br>
          User-tested my paper and low-fi prototypes to get feedback about the flow, layout, terminology and icons and adjusted the design accordingly.</p>

        <h2>Ideation</h2>
        <p>Sketching: I sketched possible solutions, then chose a solution and sketched different use cases for it.
          <br> <br>
          Personas: Wrote 5 personas based on my survey data and hypotheses about potential users, and use case scenarios for each one.
          <br> <br>
          Story Mapping: Using my use case scenarios I made sticky notes that charted each user persona’s journey through my solution concept.
          <br> <br>
          Design Synthesis & Defense: Used the QOC method to assess design possibilities for a critical feature of my product (my search feature).</p>

        <h2>Prototypes and Testing</h2>
        <p>Paper Prototypes: Made paper prototypes that show the major features of the app.
          <br> <br>
          Digital Prototype: Designed in Adobe XD. First I made 30+ low-fi artboards to test.
          <br> <br>
          Usability Testing: So far I’ve conducted 8 user tests and received a lot of useful feedback. With most tests I gave the user tasks to complete and watched if they did them easily or with difficulty. With other tests (i.e. the early ones) I used more of an interview style to get a sense of what users would actually use. More feedback below.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="project_description">
        <img src="../images/icons/orange_design_decisions.jpg" alt="icon of signs pointing different directions"/>
        <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
        <p>Format: At the beginning of this process I planned to make a website because I knew service plan data were text heavy, and I thought a webpage would be the best format for research. However, my survey data showed that many potential users felt unprepared during IEP or 504 meetings with their schools. I realized an app could be used at the meeting because it would give users quick access to their saved notes, service plans, and other documents. So that’s why my prototype is an app.
          <br> <br>
          Main Functions: Search, Post, Save and Notes.
          <br> <br>
          Search: Originally I planned only to allow users to search by location or school name, since I thought service plans are most useful in the context of an individual school. However, several early users told me they’d also like to search by disability/need. So I changed the format to search by location or keyword. The search results page now has 4 views: Schools List, Service Plans List, All (list of service plans + schools) and a Map view. I also added an advanced search page since a few of my test users were “power searchers.”
          <br> <br>
          Post: This is where users share the service plans of their own children. Service plans can be lengthy so that really affected my overall design of the app. For example, I wanted users to be able to scroll and see a bunch of posts, and not have to scroll several times to get to the bottom of 1 post. But I also wanted it to be simple to read an entire plan. So I settled on showing the “Programs & Services” part of service plans as preview text because I think that’s the “meatiest” part of the plan. Then users can expand a plan to see other sections, and swipe to see a plan’s page 2+.  The main purpose of page 2 is to read a service plan’s Goals section, which is specific to IEPs. My paper and low-fi prototypes did not include page 2+ because I didn’t plan to show the goals. My test users said they would find that information useful though so that’s why I added it in the mid-fi version. I also added indicators to each plan so users could tell even before its expanded that it contains multiple pages. The length and text-heaviness of plans is also why I showed a scan function and voice-text feature on the “Add a new post” pages.
          <br> <br>
          Save: Users can save a school or service plan and that will go into their Saved folder. At first I wanted users to be able to swipe to save (or report) a plan. However the length of the plans made swiping look weird so I changed to icons. (This ended up working out since now I use swiping to see more service plan info.) Then at one point in my testing process I grouped the save button with other functions in an ellipsis button, but users didn’t like that so now all the functions are icons that are visible. Un-saving is done by hitting the save button twice.
          <br> <br>
          Notes: Users can type notes for their meetings, or copy & paste links to schools/service plans in their notes app. They can also share notes to others. Eventually I’d love users to be able to import checklists for meetings in this section, and attach files for those checklist items.
          <br> <br>
          Icons/Labels: Based on my usability tests I redid most of my icons, which were originally not self-explanatory. I also added labels to some of them. I went through several rounds of “what do I call this IEP/504 data that people are posting?” And settled on calling them “Service Plans” as that seemed to be the least confusing/awkward label. Special Ed is full of jargon and acronyms so it was hard to know when a term is common enough that an acronym is ok, or when it needs to be spelled out. For example, on the search results page with a list of schools I wanted to indicate what special needs were present at the school so users could scan the list and see this right away. But the names of special needs, or disability categories, are long and jargon-y. If I were continuing with this I’d want to test color codes, or colored short names/acronyms where a user could click to see a little pop up or animation with the full name.
          <br> <br>
          Included but not demonstrated: My hamburger menu isn’t functional but in it is Account Settings and 3rd-party resources. A key pain point in my survey data was that there isn’t one place with all the special ed information a parent needs. And my app is not intended to be that one place. However, I did want to include some links to popular sites to get more information, especially to legal and government resources. Also, in my survey I asked people to rate (1-5) how much they understood about special ed in general and most parents self-assessed at a 2-3. I made this app with a “2” person in mind. Which means, users who don’t even know what an IEP is will need to get some basic information before they’ll be able to use my app well. The other resources section is intended to get a “1” person to at least a 2. Other functions I didn’t demonstrate: help buttons, reporting a post, account settings, and following a school. Clicking the Follow button on a school page means the person’s homepage will show new information about that school. So if a new post is added for that school a user will see it right after logging in.
          <br> <br>
          Not included: Several people asked me if this app would let users review/rate the quality of school services. At this time it doesn’t because I think that would antagonize school administrators and I want this to be a useful tool for both parents and school officials. So right now what is shared is factual information about what schools agreed to provide. I would allow posts to be reported and removed if they’re inaccurate or otherwise do not contain appropriate information.
          <br> <br>
          New ideas: I have several new ideas I’m saving for later. One is having separate profiles for each child so that families with more than 1 child receiving services could save schools or data to a specific child profile instead of it being in one big group. I’m also considering adding goal tracking and reminders when meetings are due to be scheduled or reports are expected.</p>
