        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>I’m on a team of 5 for this semester-long project. Everyone on the team is responsible for writing reports, conducting interviews and analyzing the affinity wall. My responsibilities also include client communications, managing the project timeline, and writing outlines for major assignments such as the final report and final presentation.</p>

        <h2>Organization</h2>
        <p>This class project is for a client - a local, for-profit information services company. Our research concerned their main product, a software platform. Contact me for more info.</p>
      </section>

        <h2>Project</h2>
        <p>Our client gets many sales leads for their software platform, but wants to improve their client conversion rate. When users register for a trial account sales personnel contact them and arrange for an in-depth demo of the platform. This process is effective but time-consuming. Our client wants to identify which users are the most likely to become paying customers, and focus their sales attention on them. With this in mind we conducted interviews of customers and a salesperson in order to:
          <br> <br>
          Identify differences between customers that might indicate a key behavior/characteristic to track.
          <br> <br>
          Make recommendations to improve the sales process.</p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>First we met with our client to get detailed information about the problem and explain our method of gathering and analyzing qualitative data (contextual inquiry).
          <br> <br>
          Background Research: We researched the company and industry.
          <br> <br>
          User Interviews: We wrote interview protocols and conducted interviews of customers and the main sales person for the product. Each interview lasted 45-80 minutes.
          <br> <br>
          Affinity Wall: We used information from our interviews to make affinity notes. Then we spent several hours grouping these notes into categories and analyzing them to make meaningful insights.</p>

        <h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
        <p>We found our client has three main types of customers with different use cases. However, the marketing for the product’s features and price were either generic or geared toward one use case.
          <br> <br>
          We found several things customers thought gave our client a competitive advantage: their licensing terms, willingness to update their software based on user feedback, customer service, and the interface and algorithm of their platform.
          <br> <br>
          Related to their sales process we found: Customers contact the company with technical questions instead of using the existing software tutorials. Sales personnel even provide technical support for “in-direct users”. Some customers are already familiar with the product before they purchase and don’t need a demo.</p>

        <h2>Recommendations</h2>
        <p>Gather more quantitative data at the account registration point. Before our client can analyze user behaviors and determine what indicates a likely purchase, we think they need to track more characteristics about their users. Namely: what customer type they are, their budget, and what software they currently use. We think tracking behaviors by customer type will be more accurate than analyzing all users as one group. Price was a pain point for all of our customer interviewees, so asking for a user’s budget may shed light on that. We think switching from a competitor software is a pain point for 1 customer type, but more information is needed.
          <br> <br>
          Gather more qualitative data by interviewing more users. We were only able to interview 2 of the 3 customer types, and all of our interviewees were paying customers. Although we were able to get a lot of information we think our client should get the full picture by interviewing the third customer type, and following up with non-buyers. Ideally these non-buying users could also be interviewed, but if that’s too time-consuming, even a web form or email survey might provide a lot of useful data over time.
          <br> <br>
          Once our client has more quantitative and qualitative data about their users they can analyze that and translate it into more customized messaging online. Primarily we think they should advertise a price package and features list with verbiage geared toward each customer type’s specific needs and behaviors.
          <br> <br>
          Upon first glance it may seem that our finding about providing tech support directly, especially to “indirect users,” suggests they’re spending too much time on this. However, we found their tech support was a significant factor in driving customer loyalty. And it didn’t seem to us that tech support took up too much time overall, especially since their product is easy to use. So we did not make any recommendations on this point. </p>
