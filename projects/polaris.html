        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>Design a wireframe and paper prototype of an Owner’s Dashboard consisting of resources an owner needs throughout the life of their vehicle — in 2 hours!</p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>Polaris gave us a user persona with background information, key frustrations and goals.</p>

        <img src="../images/icons/blue_ideation.jpg" alt="icon of lightbulb"/>
        <h2>Ideation</h2>
        <p>Brainstormed “How Might We _____ ” questions related to the needs of our user persona.

          Suggested solutions for each question.

          Chose a set of solutions that were most relevant for our persona and discussed the flow of the dashboard app.</p>

        <p>Drafted wireframe and paper prototype.

          Revised prototype.</p>

        <img src="../images/icons/orange_design_decisions.jpg" alt="icon of signs pointing different directions"/>
        <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
        <p>The main new feature of our dashboard was a voice-controlled virtual assistant, “Technician Taylor,” that helps owners fix and maintain their vehicles at home. We chose this feature because our persona’s main frustration was living far away from a service provider or dealership. He preferred to handle small maintenance issues himself at home. We speculated that if he had assistance he may want to fix even more issues on his own. We made it voice-controlled so it could be used while working on the car, or even while driving (not necessarily for maintenance instructions but for scheduling or checking vehicle diagnostics).</p>

        <h2>Other Features</h2>
        <p>Recall alerts, graphical vehicle diagnostics, interactive map of dealerships and service providers, recommended maintenance schedules, interactive calendar to see and book available appointment slots, and store to purchase replacement parts and vehicle accessories (with rewards). We chose these because our persona’s frustrations also included the lack of notifications and not enough vehicle accessories. </p>

        <img src="../images/icons/blue_results.jpg" alt="icon of graph showing growth"/>
        <h2>Result</h2>
        <p>We won! From this experience I learned how important it is to keep track of the time so that we don’t spend too much time on the early stages. If I were going to do this again I’d want more time to make the paper prototype and practice the presentation. However, our process for generating ideas quickly seemed to work well. Focusing on the idea and and the justification for it seemed to be more important in the end than the implementation of it in the paper prototype design.</p>
