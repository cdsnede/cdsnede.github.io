        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>Project Manager: Led a team of 10, including board members, other organizational leaders who interact with the site on the backend, and a professional developer.</p>

        <h2>Organization</h2>
        <p>Seoul International Women’s Association (SIWA) is the largest expat organization in Seoul. It provides a community for foreign and Korean women living in Seoul by hosting hundreds of events each year and providing service opportunities with local charities.</p>

        <h2>Project</h2>
        <p>Redesigning Seoul International Women’s CMS-based website to modernize its design, improve its functionality and reorganize its content to better improve its user experience.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="project_description secondary">
        <img src="../images/icons/green_problem.jpg" alt="icon of mountains"/>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>SIWA’s previous website was so outdated that its design was no longer supported by its CMS platform. New functionalities could not be added and old ones were at risk of crashing. Members used a lot of manual work-arounds to prop up the site and maintain records.</p>

      <section class="project_description">
        <img src="../images/icons/blue_goals.jpg" alt="icon of arrow hitting bullseye target"/>
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>SIWA is a membership-based organization. The previous website was used for event sign-ups, but not as a tool for expanding the membership base. I wanted the new site to further the organization’s overall mission, therefore the goals of the website redesign were:

        Drive membership.

        Improve end user experience.

        Automate and integrate some back end processes to relieve workload of volunteers.</p>

        <h2>How Goals Were Met</h2>
        <p>Used membership accounts as an event-planning tool, which drastically improved the end user’s event registration process and made the actual membership account a benefit in and of itself.

          Membership sign-ups and benefits were more prominently displayed.

          Simplified membership sign-up process.

          Allowed online payment for membership and events, which especially helped foreigners who did not own a Korean bank account. This also benefited event hosts who did not have to deal with cash payments at events.

          Navigation was simplified and number of pages were reduced so that content was more easily located.

          New design was much more mobile-friendly, which was important in Korea where nearly every member accessed our site via smart phone.

          With new membership and event plugins we were able to automate aspects of the following processes: event registration, payment, membership account approvals, and membership reports.</p>

          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p>Met with organizational stakeholders and those who operate the backend of the site to create a wish list of new website features from the organizational standpoint. Set timeline for project.
            <br><br>
            Gathered information about our members’ preferences and online behaviors via web survey and Google Analytics.
            <br><br>
            Compared user survey results with organizational wishlist and prioritized features based on a combination of user and organizational preferences.
            <br><br>
            Wrote a highly-detailed scoping document that I sent to potential developers in order to receive an accurate quote. (The developer we chose called us “the most thorough and prepared client” he had ever had.)</p>

        <img src="../images/icons/green_prototype.jpg" alt="icon of gears"/>
        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <p>First round: My redesign team (10 people) tested the developer’s prototype. In addition to finding bugs, we made a lot of content revisions and refined the site map structure. Some new features also had to be tweaked. For example, we wanted to use email addresses instead of usernames for the login ID, since usernames wouldn’t be needed anywhere else on the site. However we realized during this phase of testing that our membership plugin publicly displayed users’ email addresses in the  URL of their profile. So we had to switch the default to usernames in order to keep emails private and our developer coded it so that email addresses still worked for the login ID.
        <br><br>
        Second round: We asked all SIWA leaders (~40 people) to beta test the site. At this stage we got a lot of great feedback about the events module since this group of testers included tour leaders. We developed a better standard for event names, ticket types and changed the way people were waitlisted. We also had to hard code payment types into the back end because we wanted to offer different payment options for different types of events and that wasn’t originally possible with the standard plugin.
        <br><br>
        We went live more than 1 month early in order to coincide with the start of the new fiscal/membership year. This meant our entire membership was able to provide feedback on the entire site. Most of the initial feedback centered around the Membership module since it was the start of the new membership year, which meant everyone had to renew and pay. This was when we refined the membership form and changed some internal processes to more efficiently approve new members.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="project_description">
        <img src="../images/icons/blue_design_decisions.jpg" alt="icon of signs pointing different directions"/>
        <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
        <p>How much to customize

        Because this new site (like the old site) would be maintained by a transitional group of foreign nationals who may have little experience in web development, it was important that the back end be easy to maintain and well-documented. In some cases though we had to make a trade-off between ease of maintenance and adding new functionalities, which added to the site’s complexity. Features took precedence over maintenance, but any time we added a new features I checked how it would be integrated into the site and assessed the difficulty of maintaining that feature. After the site was launched I trained core volunteers to use the back end and wrote documentation in layman’s terms for frequently used features.
        <br><br>
        Demographics and Expectations

        The demographics of our membership were highly varied, with no nationality representing more than 25% of the total. This often meant that what one subgroup of end users found easy, another group found difficult due to different web norms across the globe. One example of this was in how membership accounts were created. We used an account creation process that is standard for Americans: Click button, Fill out an online form, Click to pay. However, to people from some other countries, especially those who did not speak much English, the form was a big stumbling block. To solve this we simplified the initial form to ask only the most necessary information, and pushed other fields to the optional account profile section (post-approval). We also offered in-person technical assistance at prospective member events.
        <br><br>
        Online Payments

        The biggest technical issue we encountered was in how to implement online payments. PayPal had come to Korea, which meant Koreans could create Paypal accounts. However the Won was not yet an approved currency for PayPal. Won can be used in Stripe payments, but not for deposits. (Getting the organization an American bank account from Korea was virtually impossible.) There were some Korea-specific payment gateways but (1) their back end documentation was written in Korean and thus couldn’t be read by the majority of our members, and (2) were pretty terrible from an end user perspective (for example requiring the end user to use Internet Explorer). We chose to use PayPal because that worked the best with the organization’s Korean bank accounts. The fees were higher than Americans familiar with their gateway would expect, but they were on par with the fees from other gateways since all of them required currency conversions. We fielded a lot of Paypal questions when we launched the site because Paypal was more finicky than we anticipated. e.g. Those with foreign Paypal accounts had to go through an annoying verification procedure, and it was picky about which domestic credit cards it would accept. But once people had used it a few times they got the hang of it.</p>

        <h2>Result</h2>
        <p>Completed project early and on-budget. New site resulted in 25% increase in active users with 12% longer duration on-site rate, leading to 20% membership boost over the previous year and doubling the percentage of new members.</p>
