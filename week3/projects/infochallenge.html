        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>I was on a team of 3. We all researched and brainstormed together. I wrote and delivered the presentation.</p>

        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>Choose a specific problem related to the lack of citizen participation in decisions that affect them. Identify a good problem, some interesting potential solutions, and generate thoughtful questions regarding one of your brainstormed solutions. Deliver a one-minute presentation of the problem, the best solution, and 3 relevant questions that would need to be answered in order to make meaningful progress on the solution. This was a 1.5-day challenge. (One day for research and designing the presentation. 1/2 day for every group to present.)</p>

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>After brainstorming several possibilities my team of 3 chose a personal pet peeve of mine: Spelling. We as individuals have no power to make our way of spelling accepted in mainstream writing.</p>

        <img src="../images/icons/orange_research.jpg" alt="icon of magnifying glass"/>
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>We spent 1/3 of our challenge time researching background information on the ill-effects of non-phonetic spelling, literacy, and what other solutions have been tried in the past.</p>

        <h2>Why is spelling a problem?</h2>
        <p>Because compared to phonetic languages English takes significantly longer to learn how to read fluently. This means our schools are spending a lot of resources on spelling that could be used for other critical subjects. Some people never achieve fluency in spelling and it’s a major contributor to functional illiteracy.
          <br> <br>
          If you didn’t learn English natively, imagine sitting in an English class trying to remember why “bead” and “lead” don’t rhyme - except when they do.</p>

      <section class="project_description">
        <img src="../images/icons/green_ideation.jpg" alt="icon of lightbulb"/>
        <h2>Ideation</h2>
        <p>After researching we brainstormed a list of possible solutions. The idea we chose was an online crowd-sourced dictionary of phonetically-spelled words, which allows users to vote on the clearest way to spell a particular word. We thought it could start with an existing dictionary and be modified from there. Other considerations included translation to and from current spelling to our new phonetic system, moderation of the site, and gameification elements.</p>

        <h2>3 Main Questions</h2>
        <p>Why have the previous attempts to standardize spellings failed?

          Can crowd-sourcing overcome apathy?

          Has texting made people more receptive to change?
          <br> <br>
          How to regulate the site?

          How to account for regional pronunciation differences?

          How to stop bots/malicious voting?
          <br> <br>
          How do we help society transition?

          How to convince institutions to change?

          How to work with software/search engines?</p>

        <h2>Result</h2>
        <p>We won “Best Problem Selection”! Actually we won “Best Problum Selekshun”. From this experience I learned a lot about how to brainstorm with people you don’t know well. We were open to all ideas and didn’t narrow down our list until we felt we had a lot of decent ideas to choose from. At one point in the day faculty members listened to our ideas and gave us early feedback. It was really helpful to bounce our ideas off others outside the group before getting too in-depth with it. If I were going to do this again I’d want to manage my time a bit better so that I got to the end stage (presentation writing and rehearsal) earlier. While our brainstorming phase was overall good, we spent too much time generating possible ideas.</p>
